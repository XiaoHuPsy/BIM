# BIM
This repository contains data and code supporting the following paper:

Hu, X., Zheng, J., Su, N., Fan, T., Yang, C., Yin, Y., Fleming, S. M., & Luo, L. (in prep). A Bayesian inference model for metamemory.

Script and data files are included in the repository to enable replication of data simulation and analyses.

**BIM uses the Particle swarm optimization algorithm to estimate free parameters, which requires MATLAB version R2014b or later.**
