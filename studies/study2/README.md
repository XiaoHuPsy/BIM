The data file **data_study2_exp1/2/3.mat** contains raw data of JOL (on a 0-100 continuous scale) and memory performance (0 or 1) for each trial.
The data file **data_study2_exp1/2/3_7bins.mat** contains raw data of JOL (on a 7-point discrete scale) and memory performance (0 or 1) for each trial.
- The **first column** is the subject ID.
- The **second column** is the experimental condition for each trial (1 = immediate JOL, 2 = delayed JOL).
- The **third column** is the JOL value for each trial.
- The **fourth column** is the memory performance for each trial.
