The data file **data_study3.mat** contains raw data of JOL (on a 0-100 continuous scale) and memory performance (0 or 1) for each trial.

Run *group_fitBIM_outputX0.m* to fit BIM to data and output the value of x0 in each trial. The results are saved in **BIMresults_study3_outputX0.mat**.

Run *computeJOL.m* to compute the JOL value for each trial.

The file **computeJOL_results.sav** contains the values of true and computed JOLs, and can be analyzed in SPSS.
